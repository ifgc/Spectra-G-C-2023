This repository contains processed data related to the publications Ghosh-Coutinho et al. [2023a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AAS...24140131G/abstract). We conducted a broad-band (3200-10000Å) and 2023b. We conducted a broad-band (3200-10000Å), high-resolution (R~31,500) spectroscopic survey of our targets using the ARC Echelle Spectrograph (ARCES) at APO. We obtained three 1200-second exposures on each of the targets with seeing of ~1" on each target. Calibration images were taken following the instrument manual, including biases, flats (quartz lamp), and wavelength calibrations (ThAr lamp). Image reduction was done using the standard IRAF script available via the aesop package [MorrisDorn-Wallenstein2018]. Individual exposures were summed together before normalising the continuum of each echelle order and merging orders into a continuous spectrum.
